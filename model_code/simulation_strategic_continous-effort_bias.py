    """
    Iteratively simulates semesters, scoring students according to a single mechanism, and recording the values of the relevant evaluation metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_iterations : int.
                     The number of semesters to simulate.
    num_assignments : int.
                      The number of assignments to include in each simulated semester.
    strategy_map: dict.
                  Maps the name of a strategy to a number of students who should adopt that strategy in each simulated semester.
    mechanism : str.
                The name of the mechanism to be used to score the students performance in the grading task.
                One of the following:
                    - "BASELINE"
                    - "DMI"

    mechanism_param : str.
                      Denotes different versions of the same mechanism, e.g. the choice phi divergence used in the phi divergence pairing mechanism.
                      "0" for mechanisms that do not require such a parameter.
