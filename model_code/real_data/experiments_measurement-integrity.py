    """
    Iteratively simulates semesters, scoring students according to a single mechanism, and recording the values of the relevant evaluation metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    assignment_partition : list of lists of ints
                      Defines the assignments in the semester (by number) and how they should be partitioned in simulations.
    mechanism : str.
                The name of the mechanism to be used to score the students performance in the grading task.
                One of the following:
                    - "BASELINE"
                    - "OA"

                    - "Phi-DIV_P"
    mechanism_param : str.
                      Denotes different versions of the same mechanism, e.g. the choice of Phi-divergence used in the Phi-divergence pairing mechanism.
                      "0" for mechanisms that do not require such a parameter.
    semester : str
              Chooses a semester for which to load data.
              One of: "Spring 17", "Fall 17", "Spring 19", "Fall 19"
    coarsen : bool, optional
             Set to true if data should be coarsened so that grades fall in the standard integer [0, 10] range.
